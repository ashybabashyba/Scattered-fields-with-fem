# Scattered fields with FEM
Project completed during a master's numerical analysis course, focusing on in-depth study of the finite element method. In this project, we investigated the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves In an infinite cylinder composed of a perfect electric conductor. We employed the TE-MFIE and TM-EFIE decompositions to determine the values of the total fields, enabling us to calculate the desired parameters.

However, a discrepancy emerged in the magnetic field calculations, potentially stemming from the omission of the second formalism, which could provide a more accurate estimation of this field. The PDF bibliography includes both the source code and the reference books employed for the theoretical framework.
